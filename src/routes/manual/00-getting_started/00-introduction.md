## What is chARp?

The chemistry Augmented Reality package (chARp) Molecular Builder offers all features a quantum chemistry researcher needs.
Beyond the ability to load and store in all file types [OpenBabel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel) supports, chARp fully supports a collaborative environment to create and discuss structures, results, and much more with colleagues.
