## Pressing Buttons
Pressing a button on the HoloLens2, feels maybe a bit off the first time you're using it.
The best way is to pretend it's a real button and try to press it all the way through.
When your finger gets close to the button, you should see some visual feedback.
When the button got pressed successfully you'll be notified by kind of a clicking sound.


## Menus
Entering chARp you're put into a menu environment, where you basically can choose the mode of operation.
