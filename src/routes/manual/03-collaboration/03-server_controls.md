## Camera
In the server scene you have several interaction possibilities.
In the case of multiple connected clients, the buttons on the bottom right labeled **next** and **previous** let you switch your current view between the clients.
The view then shows what the selected client sees.

You can also change to a specific client's view by clicking on the corresponding entry in the user panel on the left.

## Loading and Saving
In the bottom right, there are two additional buttons **Load** and **Save**.
The **Load** button opens a file dialog and lets you import all file formats supported by **OpenBabel**.
The loaded molecule appears in front of the currently selected client.
You can select a molecule in the active scene under the section **AtomWorld** and press the **Save** button to store the data in a file.
Here, you have the option to pick a supported output format (by adding the corresponding file extension) and the data is automatically converted and saved in this format.

## Other interactions
There are different shortcuts to perform specific actions on the server. 
Hovering your mouse over the *Info* icon in the top right corner shows you a list of them.
